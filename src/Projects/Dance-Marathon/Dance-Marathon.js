It is dedicated to raising money for the Foundation, but also to raising awareness about HIV/AIDS and the Foundation's work through a dynamic and culturally diverse celebration of life."

                    I designed gear and promotional material/media for the organization. I also represented the CU campus at the annual Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) Student Conference in Washington D.C. during the summer of 2012, where I advocated on Capitol Hill for Governor Andrew Cuomoâ€™s support of EGPAF and CUDM.
